### The challenge

The challenge is to build out the recipe page and get it looking as close to the deisgn as possible using semantic HTML.

## My process
I first created the base HTML and then wrote the CSS to style it.

### Built with
Semantic HTML (I think?)
Media Queries
Responsive Design

### What I learned

This was my attempt at getting back to web design learning after a hiatus.  

Media queries are still a sticking point for me, and I appreciated using those again to solidify my knowledge.  More work should be done here.

I never was that solid on box-sizing and positioning, and this was a great exercise for that.
